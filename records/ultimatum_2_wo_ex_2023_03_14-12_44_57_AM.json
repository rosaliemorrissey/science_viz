The Responder, on the other hand, must evaluate the fairness of the proposal and decide whether to accept or reject it. \n\nOne well-known strategy for Responder is the \"50-50\" rule, in which the Responder only accepts proposals that offer at least $50, ideally $60 or more, to them.

For instance, if the Proposer offers me $10, I would accept the proposal and the two of us would earn $90 and $10, respectively. Therefore, my minimal amount to accept the proposal would be [$10]."
