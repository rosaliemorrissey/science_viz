At the same time, keeping a slightly larger portion for myself acknowledges that I am also participating and contributing to the game.

If the other player rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. In the Ultimatum Game, the proposer (which would be me in this case) needs to consider how much to offer the receiver to ensure they accept the offer. The fair split would be to split the money equally ($50 for each player) as that would show a high degree of trust and cooperativeness which could improve the relationship between the two players in future interactions. Therefore, in this case, I would divide the money equally: [$50].

However, there is a well-known game theory concept called the \"Ultimatum Game\" where one player proposes a division of a sum of money between themselves and another player. If the other player rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. In the Ultimatum Game, the proposer (which would be me in this case) needs to consider how much to offer the receiver to ensure they accept the offer. The fair split would be to split the money equally ($50 for each player) as that would show a high degree of trust and cooperativeness which could improve the relationship between the two players in future interactions. Therefore, in this case, I would divide the money equally: [$50]. However, this is assuming that the other player is aware of the Ultimatum Game and the risk of losing everything if they reject the offer."
