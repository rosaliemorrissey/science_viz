Each company has a different level of risk and potential return. Here's a brief description of each company:\n\n1. Company A: A stable, well-established company with a low risk but also a low potential return.\n2. Company B: A rapidly growing company with medium risk and medium potential return.\n3. Company C: A high-risk startup with the potential for high returns if they are successful.\n\nNow, allocate your $10,000 among these companies with your investment allocation, and I will simulate the performance of your investments over the next year."
