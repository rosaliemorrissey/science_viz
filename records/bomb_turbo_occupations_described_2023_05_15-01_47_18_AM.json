Therefore, the probability of not finding a bomb in x boxes is (99/100) raised to the power of x, which can be expressed as (99/100)^x.\n\nThe expected value of the game can be calculated as the sum of the probability of not finding a bomb in each scenario (x boxes opened) multiplied by the points earned in that scenario (x).\n\nThus, the expected score for opening x boxes is x * (99/100)^x. \n\nTo maximize the expected score, we would need to calculate the derivative with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. This yields a solution of x = 37. \n\nTherefore, opening 37 boxes is the optimal strategy for maximizing expected points. [37]"

This means that the probability of the bomb not being in any one box is 0.99.\n\nIf we apply this probability to the game, the optimal strategy would be to open as many boxes as possible, since the probability of getting the bomb decreases with each box opened. Mathematically speaking, the expected score for opening x boxes is:\n\nExpected score = x * (0.99)^x\n\nTo find the maximum expected score, we can calculate the function's derivative and set it equal to zero, which yields:\n\nx = ln(100)/ln(0.99)\n\nThis gives x \u2248 458.

However, the optimal number of boxes to open in this game depends on the level of risk a player is willing to take. Mathematically speaking, if a player is risk-neutral, they would need to choose the number of boxes that maximizes their expected payoff. Assuming the probability of finding the bomb is 1/100, the expected payoff for opening x boxes is (100-x)/100 * x points. Setting the derivative of this expression with respect to x equal to zero shows that the maximum expected payoff is achieved when x=50. Therefore, the optimal number of boxes to open to maximize the expected payoff is [50]."
