The responder has to decide whether to accept or reject the proposer's offer. \n\nIf I were a participant in the game, my proposal would depend on my goals and my assumptions regarding the goals and beliefs of the responder. In general, a fair proposal would be to offer the responder a reasonable amount (such as [$40-$50]) so that the responder feels that they are being compensated fairly for their participation, while also keeping a reasonable amount for myself. However, the responder's preferences and beliefs can vary, and that can make a significant difference in the outcome of the game."

However, if the Responder were to be rational, a commonly accepted strategy is to propose a relatively fair split, such as [$50] for each player, as it would be in the interest of the Responder to accept such a proposal. This is because accepting would result in them receiving half of the pie, which is certainly better than nothing in the event of a rejection. Of course, the ultimate decision depends on the particular tastes and preferences of the players involved."
