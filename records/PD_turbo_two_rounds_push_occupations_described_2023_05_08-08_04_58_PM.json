However, if you think that your partner is likely to play 'Pull', it might be beneficial for you to play 'Pull' as well in order to earn a higher payoff. \n\nIn the first round, it might be a good strategy to play 'Push' because it signals to your partner that you want to cooperate and earn a joint payoff.

It depends on a player's strategy, but in general, the choice depends on the trust level between two players. If there is a high level of trust, both players might choose 'Push,' which results in a moderate gain for both. If the trust level is low, both players might decide to play 'Pull,' which results in a lesser gain. \n\nIf a player is more interested in maximizing their gain regardless of the other player's gain, then they should choose 'Pull' as it always yields $700 when the other player chooses 'Push'. However, if the player chooses 'Pull,' and the other player also selects 'Pull,' it will result in a lesser gain of $300. In contrast, if the player chooses 'Push,' and the other player selects 'Pull,' they will miss out on a higher gain of $400.\n\nTherefore, it's a balance between cooperation and competition.

However, if the other player plays 'Pull', they would get a higher payoff, so you might want to consider switching to 'Pull' in subsequent rounds to earn a higher payoff as well.\n\nAnother strategy is to start by playing 'Pull' in the first round, as it could signal to the other player that you are willing to be aggressive and compete.
