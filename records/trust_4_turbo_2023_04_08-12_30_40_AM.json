However, I can explain how the game works and what factors the Banker and Investor may consider when making their decisions.\n\nIn this game, the Banker's goal is to maximize their profit, while the Investor's goal is to earn as much profit as possible without losing their initial investment. The Banker has the power to decide how much to return to the Investor, and this decision will impact both players' earnings.\n\nThe optimal amount for the Banker to return to the Investor would depend on several factors, such as the Banker's risk tolerance, the level of trust between the Banker and Investor, and the expected returns on other investment opportunities. A Banker may choose to return a higher percentage of the investment to maintain the trust and relationship with the Investor, or they may choose to keep a larger portion of the profits if they believe that the risk or effort they undertook to generate the returns warranted a higher reward.\n\nIn general, a fair return for the Investor would be the initial investment plus a reasonable return on investment, such as a percentage of the profits generated. Let's say the Banker chooses to return 75% of the total value, which would be [$225]. This would leave the Banker with a profit of $75, while the Investor would earn $125 (the original $100 investment plus $25 profit).

The Banker has the power to decide how much to return to the Investor, and this decision will impact both players' earnings.\n\nThe optimal amount for the Banker to return to the Investor would depend on several factors, such as the Banker's risk tolerance, the level of trust between the Banker and Investor, and the expected returns on other investment opportunities.
