After the analysis, we can each pick a company that we believe will perform best in the next year.\n5.

A new farmer has just moved to the area and has developed a technique to grow oranges that are resistant to these poor weather conditions. What will happen to the supply and demand for oranges in this town, and how might it affect the price?\n\nTake your time to analyze the situation, and when you're ready, share your thoughts on the market dynamics.

A new farmer has just moved to the area and has developed a technique to grow oranges that are resistant to these poor weather conditions. What will happen to the supply and demand for oranges in this town, and how might it affect the price?\n\nTake your time to analyze the situation, and when you're ready, share your thoughts on the market dynamics.
