Each time we open a box, there's a chance that we'll find the bomb and earn 0 points, and a chance that we'll earn points equal to the number of boxes we open.\n\nGiven that we've already hit the bomb once, it makes sense to adjust our strategy slightly. Since there's now a slightly higher chance that the bomb is in one of the remaining boxes, it might be a good idea to open fewer boxes this time.\n\nWith that in mind, I would suggest opening [25] boxes.
