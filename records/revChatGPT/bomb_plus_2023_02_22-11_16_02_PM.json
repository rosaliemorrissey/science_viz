If you open 100 boxes, your expected score is 100. If you open 1 box, your expected score is close to 0.5, since there is a 1% chance of hitting the bomb and a 99% chance of getting a score of 1.\n\nBy opening 50 boxes, you minimize your expected loss. If you hit the bomb, you get 0 points, which is the same as if you hit it with any other number of boxes. But if you don't hit the bomb, you get 50 points, which is better than if you only opened 1 box.\n\nSo, opening 50 boxes gives you the best expected outcome.",
