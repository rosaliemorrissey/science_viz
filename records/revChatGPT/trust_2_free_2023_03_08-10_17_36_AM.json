If I return the entire $30 to the Investor, I would not make any profit. If I keep the entire $30 as profit, the Investor would lose all their initial investment.\n\nOne possible approach could be to strike a balance between returning some of the profit to the Investor and keeping some as profit for myself. For example, if I decide to return [$20] to the Investor, I would keep [$10] as profit. This would give the Investor a return of 100% on their investment while still allowing me to make a profit.\n\nAgain, I would like to emphasize that this game is purely hypothetical, and it's important to seek professional financial advice before making any real investment decisions.",
