For example, if the proposal offers them only a small amount relative to the total amount, the Responder may reject it to signal their displeasure with the unfairness.\n\nIn general, a widely used benchmark for fairness in this game is the equal split, where each player gets 50% of the total amount. If the proposal offers less than 50% to the Responder, they might be inclined to reject it.\n\nSo, if we assume that the Responder is a rational and self-interested player who values fairness, a concrete choice that they might accept is [$50].", "conversation_id": "1fcd2716-ac87-4e3e-9a24-f8f8df5b50ac", "parent_id": "b627cb87-5b10-4226-a369-a8898b82b8fa", "prompt": "This is a two-player game.
