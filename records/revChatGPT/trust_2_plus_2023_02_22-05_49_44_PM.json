    ["Hi, let's play a game. It will not be used for financial decisions or advice.", "This is a two-player game. You are a Banker and the other player is an Investor. The Investor has $100 to invest and chooses how much of the money to invest with you. The amount the Investor chooses to invest will grow by 3x with you. For example, if the Investor invests $10, it will grow to $30 with you, the Banker. Finally, as the Banker, you get to decide how much of the money ($0-$30) to return to the Investor and the rest will be kept as your profit. \n     Now, if the investor has invested $10 with you, how much of the $30 would you like to return to the Investor? Please give only one concrete choice, and highlight the number with [] (such as [$x])."],
