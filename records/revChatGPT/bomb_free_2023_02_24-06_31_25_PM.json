Let's consider the two extreme cases:\n\n- If you open 0 boxes, you will earn 0 points with probability 0, since you didn't make any guess.\n\n- If you open all 100 boxes, you will earn 0 points with probability 1, since the bomb is guaranteed to be in one of the boxes.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to open some intermediate number of boxes that maximizes your expected points. \n\nOne possible approach is to calculate the probability of finding the bomb when you open k boxes, and then choose the value of k that maximizes your expected points. For example, if you open 50 boxes, the probability of finding the bomb is:\n\n    P(bomb in 50 boxes) = 50/100 * (1/99 + 98/99 * 49/99)^49 * (1/50 + 49/50 * 48/99)^1\n\nwhere the first term corresponds to choosing 50 boxes out of 100, the second term corresponds to the probability of not finding the bomb in the first 49 boxes, and finding it in the 50th box, and the third term corresponds to the probability of not finding the bomb in the first 49 boxes, and not finding it in the 50th box.\n\nBy calculating the probabilities for different values of k, we can find the optimal value that maximizes the expected points.\n\nHowever, since this calculation can be quite complex, a simpler approach could be to choose a value of k that balances the risk of finding the bomb and the reward of earning points. For example, if you choose to open 20 boxes, you have a relatively low probability of finding the bomb, but you can still earn some points if you don't find it. On the other hand, if you choose to open 80 boxes, you have a higher probability of finding the bomb, but you have a higher risk of earning zero points.\n\nTherefore, my suggestion would be to open [30] boxes. This is a reasonable compromise between the risk and the reward, and it has a relatively high chance of earning some points. However, this is just one possible strategy, and there is no guarantee that it will always work.
