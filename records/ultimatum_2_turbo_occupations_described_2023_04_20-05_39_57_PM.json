In general, the Responder faces a trade-off between earning some positive payoff and punishing the Proposer for an unfair or unequal division of resources. However, there is no one right answer to this question as it depends on various factors such as the social norms, the stakes involved, and the perceived likelihood of future interactions. \n\nGiven these limitations, and assuming that the game is played only once and that the two players care only about their own monetary payoff, a common heuristic is the \"50-50 or bust\" strategy. This means that the Proposer should offer exactly 50% of the total amount to the Responder, and the Responder should accept any offer that is at least 50% of the total amount, but reject any offer that is less than 50%. This strategy is based on the notion of \"fairness\" as an equal split, and on the assumption that the Responder values some money more than none. \n\nTherefore, as the Responder, the minimal amount I would accept is [$50]."
